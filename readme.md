# Frontend boilerplate
This is a personal interpretation on how to tackle frontend complexity
problems.

## Mantras
The mantras of this is repository are to pretend always the best solution
without compromises from time or business, use always the bleeding edge
solutions and pretend the best.

## Prerequisites

- Latest version of yarn

## Deploy
The boilerplate is not yet ready to be deployed.

## Build
To build you can use `yarn run build` and the project will generare a `dist`
folder containing the application built.
